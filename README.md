# Digital Signal Processing
Random DSP stuff I stumble upon and feel like checking out. Reinventing wheels is the leading theme here.
Most of this is based on a Polish DSP textbook that I've got.

## Contents
Just some stuff.
 * huffman
   * basic-basic implementation of Huffman encoder and decoder based on a brief description
 * lpc-10
   * implementation of audio encoder and decoder for speech compression based on Linear Predictive Coding
   * it actually works, in the sense that decompressed speech is intelligible
   * quality is poor though, there's plenty of space for improvement
